Similarity:
We used the similarity principle in the "View Charts" page.
The similarity principle states that when things appear to be similar to each other we group them together and tend to think they have the same function.
On the "View Charts" page, the user sees two dropdown menus, one input field for stock symbol and another one for index symbol.
The dropdown menus are similar to each other visually, so do the input fields.
Not only are these two groups similar in design, they also have similar function.
Thus, the similarity principle is applied.

Proximity:
We used the proximity principle in the "Trade Stocks" page.
The proximity principle states that things that are close together appear to be more related than things that are spaced farther apart.
We put the input fields closed together because they should be seen as a group.
We do not want the user to only fill out part of these fields, rather we want all of them to be filled.
As a result, we grouped the input fields together to ensure that the user sees them as one group.
Thus, the proximity principle is applied.

Common region:
We applied the common region principle in a variety of places.
The common region principle states that when objects are located within the same closed region we perceive them as being grouped together.
It is most apparent in the reports for administrators. We utilize tables to show each users' stocks holding and Sharpe ratio.
Using a table makes the display more organized and uses the common region principle.

Closure:
We applied the closure principle in the "View Portfolio" page.
The closure principle states that when we look at a complex arrangement of visual elements we tend to look for a single, recognizable pattern.
Even though the risk profile statistics are not organized into a formal table, the user still sees them as grouped together.
The closure principle helps the user see them as a group, even though the statistics are technically separate.
